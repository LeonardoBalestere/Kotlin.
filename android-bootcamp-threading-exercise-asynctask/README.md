# Threading

This is an app who uses AsyncTask to made other threads, because if it was in the primary thread the app could crash and is a bad experience to the user, so we put it in other thread to load and don't impact badly the user experience.

*It's not a pretty app, it's just a related study test*

After Load                                             | Before Load
